Starting with an input string of words, find the second-to-last word of the string. For example, an input of “I love Codecademy” should return “love.”

To make your program more challenging, allow for a second numerical input, n, that results in returning the nth word of a string. So, for the string “I can program in Java” and n = 3, the output should be the third word, “program.”
